    "With many different companies getting into the movie industry, Microsoft has also decided to join the movement by creating its own film studio. However, asg a tech company with little to no knowledge when it comes to the film industry, Microsoft is faced with significant challenges such as: \n",
    "* identifying the types of films currently performing well\n",
    "* understanding the factors that make a film successful\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will solve these problems by analyzing the current trends in the film industry and translating those insights into tangible recommendationsi in order to make Microsoft's debut into the film industry successful. By examining what films and genres are rated higly as well as gross highly, he research will provide integral insight into the ingredients that make a film studio successful. All this tanslates to the amount of returns generated by the film studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary stakeholders of this project are the head of Microsoft's film studio and the production team. The insight generated by this project will guide the heads of the film industry to make informed decisions that will ensure the films produced align with the market demand. The insight will also be used by the production team in order to know which genres to capitalize on and which production styles to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this project is very fundamental to Microsoft as it will provide important insight that will make their insertion into the film industry successful."
